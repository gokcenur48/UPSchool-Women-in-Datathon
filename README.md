# UPSchool-Women-in-Datathon
Welcome to the repository of my project for the Women in Business and Social Life Datathon, organized in collaboration with Bitexen and UP School. This Datathon provided a unique opportunity to analyze the challenges women face in their professional and social lives and to propose data-driven solutions. I am proud to have reached the finals with my submission.
<p>This repository contains the source code and presentation materials for my Datathon project. The primary goal of the project was to analyze the provided datasets, identify key issues affecting women, and develop predictive models and insights to address these challenges.

<h2>Project Contents</h2>
<p>The project is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data analysis:</p>

<h3>Data Loading and Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Various datasets were loaded and preprocessed to ensure they were in a suitable format for analysis. Missing values were handled, and data types were adjusted where necessary.</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>Initial exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the basic structure and relationships within the data. This included summary statistics, visualizations of distributions, and correlations between variables.</p>

<h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>
<p>In-depth analysis of specific metrics such as the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work, share of women in top income groups, labor force participation rates, maternal mortality, gender wage gap, and women's entrepreneurship data.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
<p>Various machine learning models were developed and tested to make predictions related to women's workforce participation and other relevant data. This section covers data preparation, model selection, model training, and performance evaluation.</p>

<h3>Research and Findings</h3>
<p>As part of the project, literature reviews and research were conducted on women's workforce participation, entrepreneurship, and other gender-related topics. These studies were supported by the data obtained and compared with the analysis results. The findings helped us better understand the challenges and opportunities women face in the workforce.</p>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>
<p>Various visualizations were created to provide a clear and insightful representation of the data. These include bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial visualizations.</p>
<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>The datasets used in this project were sourced from the UP School Women in Datathon and include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Female to Male Ratio of Time Devoted to Unpaid Care Work</li>
    <li>Share of Women in Top Income Groups</li>
    <li>Ratio of Female to Male Labor Force Participation Rates</li>
    <li>Maternal Mortality</li>
    <li>Gender Gap in Average Wages</li>
    <li>Labor Force Participation (Male and Female)</li>
    <li>Women's Entrepreneurship Data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis revealed significant insights into the gender disparities in labor force participation, unpaid care work, and income distribution. These insights can be used to inform policy decisions and further research into gender equality in the workforce. The machine learning models helped us predict future trends. The research and literature reviews provided a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by women in the workforce.</p>
